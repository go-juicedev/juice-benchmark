### Key Findings

1. **Single Record Operations**
   - All three solutions show excellent performance
   - Differences in speed are minimal (within 3%)
   - Memory usage varies significantly

2. **Batch Operations**
   - Standard DB shows clear advantages
   - Juice offers good performance with room for optimization
   - Memory usage could be optimized in both ORMs

3. **Query Performance**
   - All implementations handle 1000 records efficiently
   - Standard DB maintains the lead in both speed and memory
   - ORMs trade some performance for convenience

## Running the Benchmarks

To run the benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=. -benchmem
```

## Environment

- Go version: 1.21
- OS: Darwin/ARM64
- CPU: Apple M1
- MySQL: 8.0

> Note: Higher numbers in Operations indicate better performance, while lower numbers in NS/Op, B/Op, and Allocs/Op indicate better efficiency.
