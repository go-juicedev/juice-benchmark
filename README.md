### Analysis

#### Single Record Creation
- Standard DB performs best at ~133Î¼s per operation
- Juice is about 5.9% slower than Standard DB
- GORM is about 8.8% slower than Standard DB
- Memory allocation patterns remain consistent with Standard DB being most efficient

#### Batch Creation (1000 Records)
- Standard DB leads at ~6.04ms per 1000 records
- Juice is about 26.1% slower than Standard DB
- GORM is about 47.8% slower than Standard DB
- Memory usage patterns:
  - Standard DB: Most efficient (578KB per op)
  - Juice: Moderate (1.33MB per op)
  - GORM: Highest (1.49MB per op)

#### Query Performance
- Standard DB processes queries in ~2.77ms per 1000 records
- Juice is about 25.8% slower than Standard DB
- GORM is about 37.1% slower than Standard DB
- Memory allocation patterns:
  - Standard DB: Most efficient (426KB per op)
  - Juice: 38.5% more memory than Standard DB
  - GORM: 63% more memory than Standard DB

#### Query With Limit Performance
- Standard DB shows best performance at ~2.65ms per operation
- Juice is about 15% slower than Standard DB
- GORM is about 60.9% slower than Standard DB
- Memory usage is notably lower compared to querying all records

#### User Batch Create Performance
- Standard DB shows best performance at ~8.64ms per operation
- Juice is about 143.4% slower than Standard DB
- GORM is about 207% slower than Standard DB
- Memory allocation patterns:
  - Standard DB: Most efficient (589KB per op)
  - Juice: 72.4% more memory than Standard DB
  - GORM: 134.1% more memory than Standard DB

### Key Findings

1. **Single Record Operations**
   - All three solutions show excellent performance
   - Differences in speed are minimal (within 3%)
   - Memory usage varies significantly

2. **Batch Operations**
   - Standard DB shows clear advantages
   - Juice offers good performance with room for optimization
   - Memory usage could be optimized in both ORMs

3. **Query Performance**
   - All implementations handle 1000 records efficiently
   - Standard DB maintains the lead in both speed and memory
   - ORMs trade some performance for convenience

## Running the Benchmarks

To run the benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=. -benchmem
```

## Environment

- Go version: 1.21
- OS: Darwin/ARM64
- CPU: Apple M1
- MySQL: 8.0

> Note: Higher numbers in Operations indicate better performance, while lower numbers in NS/Op, B/Op, and Allocs/Op indicate better efficiency.
